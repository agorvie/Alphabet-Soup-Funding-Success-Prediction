# deep-learning-challenge
Welcome to the Alphabet Soup Funding Predictor project! In this project, I aim to develop a deep learning model that predicts the success of organizations funded by Alphabet Soup. By analyzing various features of the organizations, I will create a binary classifier that can determine whether an organization will effectively utilize the funds.
